# RITA Flight Analysis
The Tableau visualizations used to analyze the RITA flight data from 2008 can be found [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/alexander.barnes#!/vizhome/US_Flight_Delays_2008_Final/FlightDelaysin2008). The analysis looks at flight delays in 2008 across airline carriers, month of the year, time of day, and other factors. The PDF document summarizes the analysis and discusses the design.

## Data Source
The data used for this analysis was downloaded from [here](http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/the-data.html) in July 2018. The file was too large to upload to GitHub.
